# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction
Utilized SQL to identify and replace null values across customer records, ensuring clean and consistent input data for analysis.

Employed Power Query in Power BI to preprocess data, remove missing values, and integrate key customer, service, and payment information.

Built an interactive Power BI churn analysis dashboard visualizing demographic, geographic, and service-related churn trends across 6,400+ customers.

Discovered that customers using Internet Service, Phone Service, Paperless Billing, and Unlimited Data exhibited over 70% churn rate, signaling product experience issues.

Segmented churn behavior by gender, age, tenure, and payment method, revealing high-risk groups (e.g., mailed check and older customers).

Developed a Random Forest classification model using historical churn data to predict at-risk customers with 84% accuracy (F1 = 0.84).

Integrated model outputs into a Power BI prediction dashboard to visualize churn probability, customer demographics, and high-risk segments for proactive retention strategies.
